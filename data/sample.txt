Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming.
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling Python developers to leverage the power of distributed computing.
Word count is often considered the "Hello World" of big data processing frameworks.
Distributed computing allows processing of massive datasets across clusters of computers.
Spark can run on Hadoop, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud.
The DataFrame API provides a domain-specific language for structured data manipulation.
Spark Connect introduces a decoupled client-server architecture for remote Spark access.
Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes enable scalable deployment of Spark applications.
Data engineering pipelines benefit from Spark's unified batch and streaming processing capabilities.
PySpark applications can integrate with various data sources including databases, file systems, and cloud storage.
Performance optimization in Spark involves understanding partitioning, caching, and broadcast variables.
The Catalyst optimizer automatically optimizes Spark SQL queries for better performance.
Tungsten execution engine provides memory and CPU efficiency improvements in Spark.
